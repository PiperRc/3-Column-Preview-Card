## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Firstly, I got better at using flexbox and I learnt things about flexbox that I would not have learnt if I had not done this project.Even though it may seem obvious, I did not know that the height of the flexbox container needed to be set. When I first tried to use centering using justify-content: center; and align-items: center; The centering only applied horizontally. Once I set height to 100vh, centering worked the way I intended.

I also realized that I need a review padding because I could not get the words to line up exactly it appears in the solution.






### Continued development

-padding, specifically to making words align the way you want them


### Useful resources

- [CSS tricks-Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)- This is a great website overall.This specific section helped me understand Flexbox.
